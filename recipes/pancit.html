  <h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>Pancit Bihon is a classic Filipino noodle dish made with thin rice noodles stir-fried with a mix of meat (usually
    chicken, pork, or shrimp), vegetables like carrots, cabbage, and celery, and seasoned with soy sauce and sometimes
    fish sauce. It's a flavorful and hearty dish that's quick to prepare and often served during celebrations or

  <h3>How to cook:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the Noodles
      <ul>
        <li>Soak the rice noodles (bihon) in warm water for about 10-15 minutes or until softened.
        </li>
        <li>Drain and set aside.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Cook the protein.
      <ul>
        <li>Heat a large pan or wok over medium heat and add a bit of cooking oil.</li>
        <li>Sauté the chicken, pork, or shrimp until cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Sauté the Aromatics.
      <ul>
        <li>In the same pan, add more oil if needed.</li>
        <li>Sauté the minced garlic and chopped onion until fragrant and softened.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Cook the Vegetables.
      <ul>
        <li>Add the carrots, celery, and shredded cabbage to the pan.</li>
        <li>Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until slightly tender but still crisp.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add Broth and Seasoning.
      <ul>
        <li>Pour in the chicken broth or water. Add soy sauce and fish sauce (if using).</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Cook the Noodles.

          vegetables.</li>
        <li>Let the noodles absorb the liquid while stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. If the mixture looks too
          dry, add a bit more broth or water.</li>

      <ul>
